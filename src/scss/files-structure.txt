Bigger Projects

For a bigger project, multiple page app, I use 7–1 pattern, it is similar to the small project file structure but with more folders. Here’s what 7–1 the pattern looks like.

    base/
    components/
    layout/
    pages/
    themes/
    abstracts/
    vendors/
    main.scss

The base, components, and layout do the same job as the file structure above. However, instead of a single file, we now manage them in a folder.

Base: animations, base, typography, and utilies.
Components: have a single scss file for each individual component
Layout: Header, footer, grid, navigation
Pages: Have a single scss for each specific page
Themes: deals with various themes (optional, I haven’t use it yet)
Abstracts: handles function, mixins, and variables
Vendor: handles 3rd party css
